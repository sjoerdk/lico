List comb. For quick-and-dirty operations on each row of a csv file. Handles boiler-plate code for IO, error handling printing progress. Optimized for single-use operations on smaller (< millions) csv files in noisy environments.

## features 

* Free software: MIT license
* Read and write CSV files
* Run custom operations for each row
* Handles errors and existing results


## Installation 

```
pip install lico
```

## Usage

### Basic example
```
    from lico import Table, process
    from lico.tests.example_classes import Concatenate

    input_list = Table.init_from_path("/tmp/input.csv")
    output_list = lico.process(input_list,
                               Concatenate(columns=['patient', 'date']))  # adds a column
    output_list.save_to_path("/tmp/output.csv")
```

## Why?

Situations in which lico might speed up your work:

* I've got a Here is an excel file of (~1000) rows including `legacy id`
* Can we find `new id` for each of these legacy ids and also add `datapoint` based on `new id`?
* This tasks never repeats in exactly this way.

There are many ways to approach this. Mine is usually to get rid of excel by parsing the data into a flat
csv file and then using a combination of a text editor and bash magic for merging, sorting. Intermediate
steps are saved for auditing.

However, for certain operations such as interacting with servers this is not enough. I then tend to use python.
This is more powerful but also creates overhead. Many of these tasks are single-use. Each time I have to slighty
modify the same code: read in csv, do something, handle errors, write output.

lico tries to get rid of that boiler plate code as much as possible.
